      The JavaScript core language features are defined in a standard called ECMA-262. The language defined in this standard is called ECMAScript. What you know as JavaScript in browsers and Node.js is actually a superset of ECMAScript. Browsers and Node.js add more functionality through additional objects and methods, but the core of the language remains as defined in ECMAScript. The ongoing development of ECMA-262 is vital to the success of JavaScript as a whole, and this book covers the changes brought about by the most recent major update to the language: ECMAScript 6.

      The Road to ECMAScript 6
In 2007, JavaScript was at a crossroads. The popularity of Ajax was ushering in a new age of dynamic web applications, while JavaScript hadn’t changed since the third edition of ECMA-262 was published in 1999. TC-39, the committee responsible for driving the ECMAScript development process, put together a large draft specification for ECMAScript 4. ECMAScript 4 was massive in scope, introducing changes both small and large to the language. Updated features included new syntax, modules, classes, classical inheritance, private object members, optional type annotations, and more.
